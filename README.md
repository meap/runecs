# RunECS CLI

RunECS: Effortlessly Execute One-Off Tasks and Database Migrations in Your ECS Cluster.

</div>

# Install

## üç∫ Homebrew

```shell
brew tap meap/runecs
brew install runecs
```

## üì¶ Other way

Download the binary file for your platform, [see releases](https://github.com/meap/runecs/releases).


# How to Use

RunECS executes the command using the specified service. The service must be specified in `cluster/service` format. Further, you must specify the environment variables that determine access to AWS.

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxxxxx
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxx
export AWS_REGION=eu-east1

runecs rake orders:upload[14021] --service my-cluster/my-service -w
```

## Commands

### Run

Executes the process using the last available task definition. You can pick a specific docker tag by using the `--image-tag` argument. In this case, it changes the task definition and inserts the specified docker tag. 

The task is run asynchronously by default. Using the `--wait` argument, the task starts synchronously and returns the EXIT code of the container.

Executing a one-off process asynchronously:

```shell
runecs run rake db:migrate \
  --service my-cluster/my-service \
  --image-tag latest
````

Executing a one-off process synchronously:

```shell
runecs run rake db:migrate \
  --service my-cluster/my-service \
  --image-tag latest \
  --wait
```

### List

The main parameter is the name of the ECS service within which the command is to be executed. The parameter value consists of the cluster name and its service. To make it easier, we have introduced a command **list** that lists all these services in the specified region.

```shell
runecs list
```

### Prune

[Deregisters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_DeregisterTaskDefinition.html) old task definitions.

Use `--keep-last` and `--keep-days` to ensure that a certain number of definitions are always available.

```shell
runecs prune \
  --service my-cluster/my-service \
  --keep-last 10 --keep-days 5
```

### Deploy

Creates a new task definition with the specified image tag and updates the service to use the created task definition for new tasks.

```shell
runecs deploy \
  --service my-cluster/my-service \
  --image-tag latest
```

### Revisions

Prints a list of revisions of the task definition. Sorted from newest to oldest. Displays the Docker image URI used in the revision.

```shell
runecs revisions \
  --service my-cluster/my-service \
  --last 10
```

## Limitations
